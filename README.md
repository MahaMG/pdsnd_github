### Project Title
Bikeshare data analysis with python

### Description
In this project, I worked on data analysis using Python.
I analyzed bike share data for America in Chicago, New York and Washington.
Firstly, filter the data by city, and secondly, filter the data by month or day or both or not at all.
The code works as calculating for:
- Calculating The Most Frequent Times of Travel
- Calculating The Most Popular Stations and Trip
- Calculating Trip Duration
- Calculating User Stats

### Files used
chicago.csv
new_york_city.csv
washington.csv
