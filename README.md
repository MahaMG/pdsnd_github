### Date created
I created this project and modified it on February 4th, 2021

### Project Title
Bikeshare data analysis with python

### Description
In this project, I worked on data analysis using Python.
I analyzed bike share data in three major cities in America "Chicago, New York, and Washington".

Firstly, filter the data by city "which city the user wants". 
Then, filter the data by month, day, or both, or not at all.

The code works as calculating for:
- Calculating The Most Frequent Times of Trip
    Popular hour
- Calculating The Most Popular Stations
    Most Frequent Start Station
    Most Frequent End Station
    Most popular trip of start station and end station trip
- Calculating Trip Duration
    Total trip time
    Avg trip time
- Calculating User Stats
    counts of user types "Subscriber, Customer, or Dependent"
    counts of gender

### Files used
The Bikeshare data that I used for the project is split into three files depending on the city:
- chicago.csv
- new_york_city.csv
- washington.csv
